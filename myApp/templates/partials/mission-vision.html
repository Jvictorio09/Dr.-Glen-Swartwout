          Your body possesses an inherent wisdom and a profound capacity to heal itself. Our mission is to simply support that natural process, helping your body do what it was designed to do.

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4">Mission:</h3>
        <p class="text-base text-slate-900/70 leading-relaxed">
          To restore humanity's relationship with the innate intelligence of the living body. The goal is to heal by fostering syntropy rather than fighting entropy. In short, in healing as in life, your purpose defines your path…

      <!-- Vision -->
      <div class="glass-card rounded-xl border border-slate-200 bg-white p-8 mb-6">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4">Vision:</h3>
        <p class="text-base text-slate-900/70 leading-relaxed">
          A world where blindness, degeneration, and chronic decline are avoidable—not inevitable. Where "irreversible" becomes an outdated belief. Where medical training serves the body's innate intelligence rather than suppressing it.

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4">The Big Why:</h3>
        <p class="text-base text-slate-900/70 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Because materialism is blind to the miracles of life and healing. The body is so much more than a dumb sack of chemicals. The Minding Body™ is a sentient self-healing masterpiece when we learn to listen and support its needs.

          "All healing is self-healing…and we are always healing. The question is, are you ready to accelerate?"
